# angular-starter

> **Problem**
> 
> The boilerplate generated by angular-cli provides great value on the build side, it doesn't comes with much answers regarding common questions in the webapp ecosystem, like the following:
>
> - How to organize your code in a scalable way
> - How to query an HTTP API
> - How to manage the different states of the application
> - How to manage your routes
> - How to manage authentication
>

The purpose of this starter is to fill step by step the above gap. As it is based over angular-cli, the user of this kit can use any `ng` command of his choice, hence can use `ng generate` to add some assets to the code.
